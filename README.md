# RagaLibrary

Welcome to the RagaLibrary! This website allows users to get a brief snapshot at some of the most popular raags (melodic scales) in the Hindustani Classical Music tradition of Northern India. The website includes a library of raags and taals, curated embedded videos of recordings of the raag/taal, a "favorites" filter to save your favorite raags, and a search feature to find a raag based on the selected notation. Hope you enjoy and can learn something!
